## Spot the Pain: Exploring the Application of Skeleton Pose Estimation for Automated Pain Assessment

Automated pain assessment is becoming an essential part of pain management focused on describing pain, such as its intensity, location or duration. These automated systems provide reliable, objective and cost-effective pain management based on machine learning applications. To enable such an automated approach, at least one pain indicator, called a modality, must be available as input to the system. So far, most studies on automated pain assessment have been based on facial expressions or physiological signals. Although body gestures are considered a pain indicator, not much attention has been paid to this modality. Using skeleton pose estimation, we can model body movements and investigate how body modality affects pain assessment performance in different approaches. In this study, we explored pain assessment approaches using skeleton pose estimation for three objectives: pain recognition, pain intensity estimation and pain area classification. Since pain is a complex experience and often expressed across multiple indicators, we analysed both unimodal approaches using only body data and bimodal approaches using skeleton pose estimation with facial expressions and head pose.

## Stronger Together? An Ensemble of CNNs for Deepfakes Detection

[Slides from a 30-min presentation of bachelor's degree project at Linneaus University in 2020](https://github.com/angelicagardner/presentations/blob/master/2020_06_04.pdf)

Deepfakes technology is a face swap technique that enables anyone to replace faces in a video, with realistic results. This presentation is about my degree project where I try to tackle the problem of deepfakes detection. Inspired by the state-of-the-art, I study the ensembling of different ML solutions built on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). I compared various ensemble approaches to combine single models and in what way their predictions should be incorporated into the ensemble output. The results I found was that the best approach for deepfakes detection is to create an ensemble, though, the ensemble approach plays a crucial role in the detection performance.

## Content Recommendation Module

[Slides from a 1-hour presentation of traction project result at [A] in 2019](https://github.com/angelicagardner/presentations/blob/master/2019_06_21.pdf)

This presentation demonstrated a content recommendation module me and the team worked on together during my traction project internship at [A]. The goals were to develop a simple web crawler to crawl a website, parse its content, process and classify the content, and load all data as a graph format.

The presentation was attended by the team, my supervisor at [A], and some from HR and management. The demonstration was also recorded.

## Improving the Chatbot Fallback Experience

[Slides from a 30-min presentation of independent degree project at Mid Sweden University in 2019](https://github.com/angelicagardner/presentations/blob/master/2019_06_03.pdf)

Chatbots are computer programs with the capability to lead a conversation with a human user. When a chatbot is unable to match a userâ€™s utterance to any predefined answer, it will use a fallback intent; a generic response that does not contribute to the conversation in any meaningful way. In this presentation, I talked about my independent degree project aiming to investigate if a content-based recommender system could provide support to a chatbot agent in case of these fallback experiences. The recommender system developed in my project consists of four components: a web spider, a Bag-of-words model, a graph database, and the GraphQL API. The anticipation was to capture web page articles and rank them with a numeric scoring to figure out which articles that make for the best recommendation concerning given subjects. The chatbot agent could then use these recommended articles to provide the user with value and help instead of a generic response. After the evaluation, it was found that the recommender system in principle fulfilled all requirements, but that the scoring algorithm used was too simple.
